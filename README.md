Heart Disease Prediction using KNN

This repository demonstrates the project of "Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning". This project has been created by implementing the K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. Initially, the Machine Learning model of KNN Algorithm is trained 80% using heart_disease_train dataset and later on the expected results are tested and obtained successfully with 20% of dataset used for the testing purposes. The accuracy of around 83.88 % was achieved after the successful execution of the Machine Learning Model.
